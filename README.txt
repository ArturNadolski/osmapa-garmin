This is set of files (mkgmap, mkgmap styles, TYP files and helper scripts) used to compile Garmin maps of Poland called
OSMapa (available at http://garmin.osmapa.pl)

At present point this may not work 'out of the box' because some files or temporaty files are not created automatically.
Most useful thing at this point is style of the map.
